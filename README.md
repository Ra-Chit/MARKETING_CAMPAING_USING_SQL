**ABOUT :**

The project involves data analysis using a dataset that includes customer information and interactions with the company. The dataset contains attributes such as customer ID, birth year, education level, marital status, income, and other relevant variables.

Using SQL, the project focuses on analyzing the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and satisfaction. SQL queries are employed to explore various aspects of the data, such as calculating aggregate measures, filtering data based on specific criteria, and grouping data to perform aggregations and comparisons.

Additionally, a dashboard has been created to visualize and present the analyzed data in a clear and concise manner. The dashboard provides an interactive interface that allows stakeholders to explore the dataset visually and understand key trends, patterns, and metrics.

Overall, the project aims to leverage SQL and data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights from the dataset and communicate those insights effectively through a user-friendly dashboard interface.
